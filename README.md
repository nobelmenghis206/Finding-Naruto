# Finding Naruto Game

Welcome to the Finding Naruto Game! This project was crafted as part of my web programming course at UW CSE 154. It's a captivating and interactive game where users embark on a quest to locate Naruto hidden behind a series of cards, all while striving to find him within a limited number of attempts. Additionally, players have the freedom to select different difficulty levels, with harder levels offering fewer attempts to find Naruto.

**Project Inspiration:**
As a passionate fan of Naruto and its captivating storyline, I embarked on this project to combine my love for the series with my web programming skills. The result is an engaging and challenging game that brings the excitement of Naruto to life.

Give it a try using the demo link below and see if you can successfully locate Naruto within the allotted attempts. Best of luck, and enjoy the game!
