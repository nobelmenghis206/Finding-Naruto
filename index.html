          In this exciting game, your objective is to locate Naruto among a
          collection of flip cards. Test your memory and concentration skills as
          you try to uncover the hidden Naruto within the allotted number of
          attempts.
        </p>
        <p>Here's how to play:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Choose a difficulty level: Each level presents a unique challenge
            with varying numbers of flip cards and attempts allowed. Select a
            level that suits your preference and skill level.
          </li>
          <li>
            The game begins: You'll be presented with a grid of flip cards,
            face-down. Your task is to find the card that hides Naruto.
          </li>
          <li>
            Flip the cards: Click on cards to reveal what's underneath.
            Remember, you have a certain amount of tries based on which level
            you choose!
          </li>
          <li>
            Each level grants you a specific number of tries before the game
            ends. Use your attempts wisely to increase your chances of finding
            Naruto.
          </li>
          <li>
            Success or failure: If you manage to find Naruto within the given
            number of attempts, congratulations! You win the game! If you
            exhaust all your attempts without finding Naruto, don't worry. You
            can always try again or choose a different difficulty level on this
            page.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Remember, good luck is on your side! Have a fantastic time playing
          "Find Naruto" and enjoy the thrill of uncovering the hidden card!
